# 0x09. Python - Everything is Object

## Overview

This project dives into the core concept that "everything is an object" in Python. It aims to improve your understanding of object types, memory allocation, variable behavior, and other fundamental aspects of Python. The project includes questions and tasks designed to enhance your grasp of Python's behavior with different types of objects, object mutability, references, and more.

## Background Context

Ever wondered how Python handles variables and objects? This project will guide you in answering questions like:

- What is the difference between an object and an instance?
- How does Python manage immutable and mutable objects?
- What is aliasing and mutation?
- How can you identify if two variables refer to the same object?

The project emphasizes the importance of understanding Python's behavior as it's a valuable skill for interviews related to Python positions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without needing to consult external resources:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is an object
- The difference between a class and an object (or instance)
- The difference between immutable and mutable objects
- What is a reference
- What is an assignment
- What is an alias
- How to know if two variables are identical
- How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
- How to display the variable identifier (memory address in the CPython implementation)
- The concepts of mutable and immutable objects
- The built-in mutable types
- The built-in immutable types
- How Python passes variables to functions

## Requirements
