# Object-Relational Mapping with Python

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Python application that integrates with a MySQL database using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). ORM allows us to interact with databases using Python objects, making it more intuitive and abstracting away the complexity of SQL queries.


## Project Structure
  1. In the first part, the module MySQLdb is used to connect to a MySQL database and execute SQL queries.
  2. In the second part, the module SQLAlchemy, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), is used.
