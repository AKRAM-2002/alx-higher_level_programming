## Project Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Your code should follow the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) guidelines.
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your test files should end with a new line.
- All your test files should be inside a folder named `tests`.
- All your test files should be text files with the extension `.txt`.
- All your tests should be executed by using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`.

- All your functions should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`).
- Documentation should be a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified).
- Collaboration on test cases is encouraged to ensure all edge cases are covered, as the Checker checks for tests.

## Project Tasks

### Task 0: Integers Addition

**Description:** Write a function that adds two integers. The function should have the following prototype:

```python
def add_integer(a, b=98):
a and b must be integers or floats; otherwise, raise a TypeError exception with the message "a must be an integer" or "b must be an integer".
If a and b are floats, they should be cast to integers.
The function should return an integer, which is the addition of a and b.
You are not allowed to import any module.

**Example:**
print(add_integer(1, 2))  # Output: 3
print(add_integer(100, -2))  # Output: 98
print(add_integer(2))  # Output: 100
print(add_integer(100.3, -2))  # Output: 98
try:
    print(add_integer(4, "School"))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)  # Output: b must be an integer
try:
    print(add_integer(None))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)  # Output: a must be an integer

Requirements:

Files: 0-add_integer.py, tests/0-add_integer.txt
Task 1: Divide a Matrix
Description: Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix. The function should have the following prototype:

def matrix_divided(matrix, div):

matrix must be a list of lists of integers or floats; otherwise, raise a TypeError exception with the message "matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats".
Each row of the matrix must be of the same size; otherwise, raise a TypeError exception with the message "each row of the matrix must have the same size".
div must be a number (integer or float); otherwise, raise a TypeError exception with the message "div must be a number".
div can't be equal to 0; otherwise, raise a ZeroDivisionError exception with the message "division by zero".
All elements of the matrix should be divided by div and rounded to 2 decimal places.
The function should return a new matrix.
You are not allowed to import any module.

**Example:**
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
]
print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
# Output:
# [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Requirements:

Files: 2-matrix_divided.py, tests/2-matrix_divided.txt
Task 2: Say My Name
Description: Write a function that prints "My name is <first name> <last name>." The function should have the following prototype:


def say_my_name(first_name, last_name=""):
first_name and last_name must be strings; otherwise, raise a TypeError exception with the message "first_name must be a string" or "last_name must be a string".
The function should print "My name is <first name> <last name>."
Example:


say_my_name("John", "Doe")
# Output: My name is John Doe
say_my_name("John")
# Output: My name is John
Requirements:

Files: 3-say_my_name.py, tests/3-say_my_name.txt
Task 3: Print Square
Description: Write a function that prints a square with the character #. The function should have the following prototype:


def print_square(size):
size is the size length of the square. size must be an integer greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, raise a TypeError exception with the message "size must be an integer" or "size must be >= 0".
The function should print the square using the # character.
You are not allowed to import any module.
Example:


print_square(4)
# Output:
# ####
# ####
# ####
# ####
Requirements:

Files: 4-print_square.py, tests/4-print_square.txt
Task 4: Text Indentation
Description: Write a function that prints text with two new lines after each of these characters: ., ?, and :. The function should have the following prototype:


def text_indentation(text):
text must be a string; otherwise, raise a TypeError exception with the message "text must be a string".
There should be no space at the beginning or end of each printed line.
You are not allowed to import any module.
Example:


text = "This is a simple text. But this text, is not so simple."
text_indentation(text)
# Output:
# This is a simple text.
# But this text, is not so simple.
Requirements:

Files: 5-text_indentation.py, tests/5-text_indentation.txt
Task 5: Max Integer - Unittest
Description: In this task, you will write test cases for the max_integer function from the 6-max_integer.py module. The max_integer function is intended to find and return the largest integer in a list of integers. You need to write test cases to ensure this function works correctly.

Your test cases should be in a file named 6-max_integer_test.py inside the tests folder.
The test cases should use the unittest module.
You should have test cases that cover different scenarios, such as:
A list with positive integers.
A list with negative integers.
A list with both positive and negative integers.
An empty list (where the function should return None).
A list that contains non-integer elements (where the function should raise a TypeError).
Your test cases should thoroughly check the behavior of the max_integer function.
Requirements:

Files: 6-max_integer.py, tests/6-max_integer_test.py
Task 6: Matrix Multiplication
Description: Write a function that multiplies 2 matrices. The function should have the following prototype:


def matrix_mul(m_a, m_b):
m_a and m_b must be lists of lists of integers or floats.
If m_a or m_b is not a list of lists, raise a TypeError exception with the message "m_a must be a list of lists" or "m_b must be a list of lists."
If m_a or m_b is an empty list, raise a ValueError exception with the message "m_a can't be empty" or "m_b can't be empty."
If m_a or m_b contain elements that are not integers or floats, raise a TypeError exception with the message "m_a should contain only integers or floats" or "m_b should contain only integers or floats."
If m_a and m_b have different lengths, raise a ValueError exception with the message "each row of m_a must be of the same size" or "each row of m_b must be of the same size."
If the number of columns in m_a is different from the number of rows in m_b, raise a ValueError exception with the message "m_a and m_b can't be multiplied."
You are not allowed to import any module.
Example:


m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
m_b = [[2, 0], [1, 2]]
